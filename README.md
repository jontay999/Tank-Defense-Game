# Tank-Defense-Game


## Introduction
The task is to train a neural network using reinforcement learning for a tank game, to maximise rewards by shooting enemy tanks and collecting ally tanks using Unity3D and the mlagents library. 

## Objectives
The objective of the game is to accumulate 20 points in the shortest time possible. Points are gained by shooting enemy tanks and collecting ally tanks. Points will be lost by letting enemy tanks breach the front line or shooting ally tanks. The game ends in a loss when the player tank collides with an enemy tank or falls off the platform.
